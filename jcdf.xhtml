<h1>JCDF</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>JCDF is a pure java library capable of reading files in the
<a href="http://cdf.gsfc.nasa.gov/">Common Data Format</a> defined by NASA.
It runs within the J2SE1.5 (or later), but other than that has no dependencies,
neither the official CDF C library nor any other java class libraries.
</p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>The classes are provided with comprehensive
<a href="javadocs/index.html">javadocs</a>.
Start reading at the
<a href="javadocs/uk/ac/bristol/star/cdf/CdfContent.html"
                                  ><code>CdfContent</code></a> class.
</p>

<h2>Comparison with the official CDF library</h2>

<p>JCDF is a completely separate implementation from the Java interface to
the official CDF library, which uses native code via JNI.
It was written mainly with reference to the CDF Internal Format Description
document (v3.4).
</p>

<p>The main benefit of using JCDF, and the reason for developing it, 
is that it's pure java, so it can be deployed using only the JCDF jar file.  
There is no need to install the system-dependent official CDF library.
</p>

<p>The API is very different from that of the official CDF library.
JCDF gives you a simple view of the CDF file, in terms of its 
global attributes, variable attributes and variables.
This is fairly easy to use, but may or may not suit your purposes.
It's also possible to get a low-level view of the CDF file as a 
sequence of CDF records.
</p>

<p>JCDF offers no capabilities for writing or editing CDF files,
it only reads them.
</p>

<p>JCDF is based on NIO mapped ByteBuffers, it's expected to be reasonably
fast, but I haven't done any benchmarking.
</p>

<h2>Utilities</h2>

<p>The library comes with a couple of simple utilities for examining
CDF files:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong><code>CdfList</code></strong>:</dt>
<dd>displays the metadata and data from a CDF file,
    along the lines of the <code>cdfdump</code> command in the official
    CDF distribution.
    If the <code>-data</code> flag is supplied, record data as well as
    metadata is shown.
    See <a href="cdflist.html">example</a>.
    </dd>
<dt><strong><code>CdfDump</code></strong>:</dt>
<dd>displays a dump of the sequence of low-level
    CDF records found in the CDF fil, along the lines of the
    <code>cdfirsdump</code> command in the official CDF distribution.
    If the <code>-fields</code> flag is supplied, field information from
    each record is shown.  If the <code>-html</code> flag is supplied,
    the output is in HTML with files offsets displayed as hyperlinks,
    which is nice for chasing pointers.
    See <a href="cdfdump.html">example</a>.
    </dd>
</dl>

<h2>Downloads</h2>

<p>The source code is hosted on
<a href="https://github.com/mbtaylor/jcdf/">github</a>.
It comes with a makefile that can be used to build the jar file and
javadocs, and to run some tests.
</p>

<p>Pre-built copies of the jar file and documentation
for the current version can be found here:

<h2>History</h2>

<dl>
<dt><strong>Version 1.0 (25 Jun 2013)</strong></dt>
<dd>Initial release</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Context</h2>

<p>This software was written by 
<a href="http://www.star.bristol.ac.uk/~mbt/">Mark Taylor</a>
at the University of Bristol at the request of, and funded by,
the science archive group at ESA's European Space Astronomy Centre (ESAC).
</p>

<p>It is used within
   <a href="http://www.starlink.ac.uk/topcat/">TOPCAT</a
 >/<a href="http://www.starlink.ac.uk/stilts/">STILTS</a
 >/<a href="http://www.starlink.ac.uk/stil/">STIL</a>
to enable access to CDF tables alongside other tabular data formats
by that software.
</p>

<p>It is licenced under the LGPL, though if you need a different licence
I can probably fix it.
